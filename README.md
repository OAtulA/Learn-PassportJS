# passport-jwt branch

I want to learn passport-jwt.  

Now I have solved the error with the help of [0xTux](https://github.com/0xTux)  

Thanks for the visit.

## SETUP INSTRUCTIONS

Ensure `npm` is installed.

*If you don't use `node 20` or above. Please modify the dev in package.json.  I do not use nodemon*

### CLone this repo

`git clone git@github.com:OAtulA/Learn-PassportJS.git`

`cd` into the folder.

### Start the mongodb on your system
As my code uses the local mongodb.

### Node part

Paste it in the terminal and it should start at `http://localhost:8002`
```
npm i pnpm
pnpm i
pnpm run dev
```

## üí°Ô∏è Checking the Routes

I have a directory `Dummy_requests` there are  few files in it.  
Just directly execute them to check the routes.

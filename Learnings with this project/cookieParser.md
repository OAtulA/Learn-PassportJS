# COokie Parser

While seeking help from [oxTux](https://github.com/0xTux)  
he brought to rescue, `cookie-parser` library.  

This has to be used in the app.  
So that we get the cookies. 🍪️🍪️

This had me stuck and self doubting.  
This had me for like 2 weeks.  
Even Chat GPT didn't  suggest that.  

Feeling absolute dumb.  
But thanks to oxTux for helping me.  

Also I am happy to have asked, else would have remained stuck on it.
